# üéÖüèª <br /> Indie app santa

### What is it? <br />
> Indie santa app is like an advent calendar but for apps made by indie iOS developers, from December 1st to 24th they share their apps mostly for free but sometimes it can be discount for in app purchase. <br />

Note that this repository has nothing to do with Indie app santa, it's made by me just for fun and for archive. <br />
